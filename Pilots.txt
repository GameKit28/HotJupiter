Pilots have a few stats:

Aim - Accuracy when using blasters.
GForce Tolerance - How many g-forces before a pilot blacks out?
GForce Resistance - How many g-forces does a pilot ignore from a menuever?

Advanced Menuevers

Idea:
Pilots have skill levels (from 1 to 5 for example) where each advancement in a skill level unlocks the ability to do a particular menuever. Barrel Roll may be unlocked after Roll Level 2 for example.
